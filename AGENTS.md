# AGENTS.md

Surge / Quantumult X proxy scripts that scrape JD (京东) cookies from intercepted app traffic and push them into a Qinglong (青龙) panel as `JD_COOKIE` env vars.

## Build, test, CI

No bundler, no linter, no CI. `package.json` exists **only** to pin the test command — the shipped scripts have zero dependencies and are deployed by raw GitHub URL, never from `node_modules`.

```sh
npm test          # node --test test/*.test.js  (53 tests, ~6s, no deps)
```

Run the glob, not bare `node --test`: Node treats every `.js` under `test/` as a test file, so `test/helpers/harness.js` would run as a phantom empty test.

The suite runs the real scripts inside a `vm` sandbox with stubbed `$request` / `$persistentStore` / `$httpClient`, so it exercises actual behaviour rather than mirroring it. It covers the sync-flow invariants below, plus static checks that fail when the trigger regex, remote URLs, or timeout budgets drift apart. Every test was verified to fail when its target bug is reintroduced.

**Harness gotcha:** `Env.post()` dispatches on `$httpClient[opts.method.toLowerCase()]`, so a DELETE lands on `$httpClient.delete`, not `.post`. A stub that only defines `post` yields `$httpClient[s] is not a function` — a fake failure that looks like a code bug.

Tests cannot prove on-device behaviour. Before pushing, still verify manually:
1. Install/reload the module in Surge (or QX), open the JD app.
2. Surge → 首页 → 最近请求 → find `api.m.jd.com` → read script logs.

Logs are the only on-device debugging channel. Keep the emoji log convention (✅ ❌ ⚠️ 🔄 🧹 ⏭️ ➕) — it is how users grep the log pane.

## Deployment is live and unversioned

Consumers install by raw GitHub URL from `main`:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conversun/jd_surge/main/<file>`

A push to `main` reaches every user on their next module refresh. There is no staging branch and no release tag. Treat `main` as production.

## Files and how they load

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `jd_cookie_sync.js` | Main script. Runs as Surge `type=http-request` on every matching JD API call. Reads `$request.headers` only (`requires-body=0`). |
| `config_helper.js` | Panel/manual utility. Dispatches on `$argument`: `smart-check`, `clear`, `clear-cache`. |
| `jd_cookie_sync.sgmodule` | Surge module: script binding + `[MITM] hostname = %APPEND% api.m.jd.com`. |
| `jd_cookie_sync.snippet` | QX equivalent (`url script-request-header`). Must stay in sync with the sgmodule's regex. |
| `config_panel.sgmodule` | Optional Surge panel. Wires only `smart-check` and `clear-cache`. |
| `Scripts/QuantumultX/*.js` | 12-line QX loader stubs that `eval()` a remote `config_helper.js` — see gotcha below. |

Scripts are standalone: **no imports, no modules, no bundler**. Each file ends with a single-line minified vendored `Env()` adapter — always the last line, so find it with `grep -n '^function Env'` rather than trusting a line number. The two blobs are byte-identical. **Never hand-edit that line** — replace wholesale if it must change, and change both.

## Gotchas that cost time

**`Env` exposes only `$.get()` and `$.post()`.** There is no `$.delete()`/`$.put()`. Non-GET requests go through `post` with the real verb in `opts.method` — see `httpRequest()` in `jd_cookie_sync.js`. (`CLAUDE.md` claims all verbs are natively supported; that is wrong — commit `a35322c` fixed exactly this bug.)

**QX loader stubs `eval()` a remote file.** `Scripts/QuantumultX/*.js` fetch `config_helper.js` from `conversun/jd_surge@main` at runtime — they carry no logic of their own beyond setting `$argument`. They previously pointed at a `W-Webber/jd_surge@feature-qx` fork, so QX panel users never received changes made here; if you see that fork URL reappear, it is a regression.

**Trigger regex lives in two files.** `jd_cookie_sync.sgmodule` and `jd_cookie_sync.snippet` each hardcode
`functionId=(getJDUserInfoUnion|queryJDUserInfo|myHomeV2|home|wareBusiness|basicConfig|logConfig)`.
Change one → change the other. (`CLAUDE.md` lists only `wareBusiness|basicConfig`; stale.)

**All accounts share the name `JD_COOKIE`.** There is no `JD_COOKIE_2`/`_3`. Identity is the `pt_pin` parsed out of the env `value` (`extractPtPinFromEnv`). The README's multi-numbered-variable claim is stale — do not "restore" it.

**Qinglong `DELETE /open/envs` requires an integer array**, e.g. `[28, 29]`. String IDs fail with a type error. Hence `Number(envId)` in `deleteEnv`.

**Duplicate-value rejection is success.** Adding an env whose value already exists returns `code: 400` with `errors[].type === 'unique violation'` on `path: 'value'`. Treat as synced, no user notification.

**`_respType: 'all'`** is required on Qinglong calls to get the raw `response.body` back for `JSON.parse`.

**Cache is written only after a confirmed sync** (`updateCache` runs inside the success branch). Do not hoist it — commit `1a2d203` fixed that ordering. Note this removed the original concurrency guard; that job now belongs to the sync lock below, so do not re-solve it by hoisting the cache write again.

**Sync order is add-then-delete, and must stay that way.** `handleExistingEnvs` adds the new `JD_COOKIE` *before* deleting stale ones. Reversing it reintroduces a window where a killed script leaves the account with zero cookies in Qinglong. Two follow-on rules: if `addEnv` fails, keep the old envs and return early; if it returns `isDuplicate`, the new value landed on some *other* env row, so skip the cleanup or the account ends up with nothing.

**One sync at a time per account.** `acquireSyncLock` / `releaseSyncLock` use `jd_cookie_syncing_{ptPin}` with a `SYNC_LOCK_TTL` expiry, released in a `finally`. The persistent store has no atomic compare-and-swap, so this only narrows the race from a multi-second network round-trip to a single read+write — it is not a true mutex. The TTL exists because Surge can kill the script mid-flight; without it a crashed run would wedge the account forever. The trigger regex matches 7 `functionId`s, several of which fire concurrently at JD app launch, so this path is exercised constantly.

**Timeout budgets must nest.** `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (6s, `jd_cookie_sync.js`) must stay well under the sgmodule's `timeout=20`, because a full sync is up to 4 serial round-trips. When the module value was `10`, the internal timeout could never fire — Surge killed the script first, landing it in exactly the interrupted-write window described above. Change one, re-check the other.

## Runtime constraints

- Persistent store cannot be enumerated. "Clear cache" therefore sets a `jd_bypass_interval_check = 'true'` flag that the next run consumes and resets, rather than deleting per-`pt_pin` keys.
- Every entrypoint must terminate with `$.done({})` / `$.done()`, including the error path (`finally` block).
- Surge supplies `$argument` from the sgmodule `argument=`; the QX stubs declare it as a `const` before `eval`.

## Skip conditions in the main script (do not remove)

1. `User-Agent` must start with `JD4iPhone` — filters out browsers and third-party clients.
2. Guest cookies rejected: `pt_key` starting with `fake_`, or `pt_pin` equal to `guest`.
3. Time-interval throttle, default 1800s via `ql_update_interval`; bypassed when the cookie value actually changed, or when the bypass flag is set.

## Storage keys

Config: `ql_url`, `ql_client_id`, `ql_client_secret`, `ql_update_interval`, `jd_bypass_interval_check`.
Per-account cache: `jd_cookie_cache_{ptPin}`, `jd_cookie_last_update_{ptPin}`, `jd_cookie_syncing_{ptPin}` (lock).

## Conventions

- Chinese for user-facing strings, log messages, and commit subjects (`fix:` / `feat:` / `refactor:` prefixes, Chinese body).
- Secrets are masked in any UI output (`maskString`); never log a raw `pt_key`, `client_secret`, or full cookie.
- API helpers return `{ success, message }` objects and log the failure themselves rather than throwing.
- User-facing alerts go through `$.msg(title, subtitle, body)`. `$.notify()` is not used anywhere in this repo despite what `CLAUDE.md` says.

## Related docs

`CLAUDE.md` has useful Qinglong API detail (auth flow, response shapes, DELETE integer-array rule, unique-violation payload) but its Architecture, Constraints, Debugging, and Pattern-Matching sections have drifted: the trigger regex, the HTTP-verb claim, the `$.notify()` reference, and the sample log strings (`✅ 成功提取 Cookie`, `⏰ 距离上次更新未满`, `🔍` debug prefix) no longer match the code. Prefer the code.
